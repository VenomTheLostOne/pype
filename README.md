## ***PyPe Share***

  
  

Pype, is an impressive Python project that utilizes Flask and hashlib to create a secure file-sharing platform. By allowing users to upload files, hashing them using the robust sha3_512 algorithm, and storing them in an encrypted folder with a randomized file name.

  

The added feature of requiring a specific URL to access the encrypted folder further reinforces the security measures of Pype, ensuring that only the intended recipient has access to the file.

  

Overall, Pype is a practical and functional tool that provides a reliable way to share files, making it suitable for both commercial and educational purposes. In today's world, where data privacy is paramount, Pype's strong encryption and authentication measures make it a valuable asset to anyone looking for a secure file-sharing solution.
